Objective:
To predict the probability of a flood occurring within 24hrs at or nearby the user’s location.

Abstract:
1> An android app which uses artificial neural networks and decision tree algorithms to predict the possibility of a flood, if there is any, at least 24 hrs before.

2> The app would collect the demographic data of the user’s locality ( thereby requiring the user’s location) from the various data sources available.

3> To make the app usable in regions where there is lack of continuous internet connectivity, the app would not require internet connection 24/7, just once in a day connection would be sufficient for the prediction of next 24hrs.

4> For successful future predictions, we will regularly train our databases with the floods and other disasters that occur with time.

5> To assess the damage caused by any ongoing or recently occurred flood.

6> Our first objective is to make it specific to all Indian states and then generalize our database to all over the world.

7> If time permits, we aim to extend our app to provide predictions for landslides and cloudbursts as well.
